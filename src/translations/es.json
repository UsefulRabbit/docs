[MapRoulette.org](https://maproulette.org/) gives you small **Tasks** you can complete in under a minute to improve OpenStreetMap. Anyone can create groups of tasks, called **Challenges**, that the community can complete together.\n\nBesides the website maproulette.org, there is also a full API that you can use to integrate MapRoulette with your own tools.\n\nOn this wiki, you will find all the resources you need to use MapRoulette.org, create and manage Challenges, see statistics and interact with the MapRoulette API.\n\nHelp is welcome! If you have suggestions for this documentation, or don't understand how something works, please email us at [maproulette@maproulette.org](mailto:maproulette@maproulette.org) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3/issues).",
