When you complete a task, you can now add a MapRoulette-specific tag to the task. Currently, you cannot search for these tags in MapRoulette, but they do appear in the CSV and GeoJSON task exports the Challenge owner can download. That makes them particularly interesting for Challenge owners. Say, for example, you have a challenge in an area where you know there may not be enough high-quality imagery available for mappers to complete all the tasks successfully. You can ask mappers to add a tag when they encounter that situation, for example `bad-imagery`. Later, when you download the tasks export, you can analyze the tags and find out which areas didnâ€™t have good enough imagery (and start an OpenDroneMap + OpenAerialMap project there ðŸ™‚ )
