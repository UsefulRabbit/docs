When logging into MapRoulette, you'll be presented with a customizable layout of different widgets that can help you get started on some challenges or see some highlights of your accomplishments and recent contributions.

The main dashboard widget will display your current points and leaderboard status, and provides easy access/direction to challenges you've been working on or new challenges that may interest you.

Just like most of the projects, challenges, and task pages, you can customize the layout of your dashboard to make it more personalized.

# Follow

Follow allows you to track the activity of other users, add new users to follow, and see who is following you.  You can also control who follows you by blocking users if you choose.

To follow a new user, click on **Following** at the top of the widget and input a users name.  A dropdown of located users by your input will display and you can click on the user.  The followed user will display on your list and the activity column will update appropriately.  You can also click on their name and view their MapRoulette user page.
