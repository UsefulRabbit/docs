description: "Virtual Projects provide a flexible means of loosely organizing disparate Challenges into ad-hoc groupings without having to move the challenges from their original projects. Whereas a challenge can only belong to a single standard project, it can be a member of any number of virtual projects. Anyone can create virtual projects and can add any challenge to their virtual project that is either publicly visible or to which they have at least read access (via permissions on the challenge's standard parent project). The admins of a virtual project can add other members to their virtual project, assigning them Read, Write, or Admin access."
