We need translators to help us make MapRoulette's Documentation available in multiple languages.

Just like the Maproulette site, if you are multi-lingual and would like to contribute, please visit our [Transifex Page](https://explore.transifex.com/maproulette/mr-docs/)

## When Will I See My Contrubutions on the Documentation Site?

Once your contributions are submitted and reviewed, the development team will update the translation files of the documentation site.  Typically the deployment cadence is once a month.

Your support is appreciated, as this will create more access to community contribution to MapRoulette.
