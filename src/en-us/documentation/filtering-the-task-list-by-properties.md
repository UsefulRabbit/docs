title: 'Challenge Managers: filtering tasks by properties'
description: 'When analyzing your challenges as a manager, it can sometimes be useful to filter tasks by property values (such as OSM tags). It has been possible since v3.4.4 of MapRoulette to filter tasks by the value of a single task property, but v3.5.3 brings the ability to create compound filtering rules that can AND and OR together multiple properties to achieve fine-grained filtering.'
